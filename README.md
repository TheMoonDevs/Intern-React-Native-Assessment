  - On the "Cart" screen, clicking a cart item's name should open the "Details" screen for that item.
  - The "Details" screen should have a back button:
    - If accessed from the "Cart" screen, the back button should return to the "Cart" screen.
    - If accessed from the "Home" screen, the back button should return to the "Home" screen.


**3. Persistence:**
- Ensure that cart data is persistent across sessions using local storage (AsyncStorage) **[Please create a reusable custom hook for this]**.
